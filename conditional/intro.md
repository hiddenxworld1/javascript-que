//Conditional Statement

/*

“The conditional operator (also called the ternary operator) is a short way to write an if–else statement. It checks a condition and returns one value if the condition is true, and another value if the condition is false.”

Syntax : 
condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;

Example : 

let age = 18;
let message = age >= 18 ? "Eligible to vote" : "Not eligible";
console.log(message);
